## Success Criteria by Page

Use this to self-check quality before submitting:

- **Page 1 (Cover Page) Proficient:** visual hierarchy is clear, spacing is clean, image is relevant, and alt text describes the image purpose.
- **Page 2 (Resume Page) Proficient:** sections are easy to scan, bullets are specific and impact-focused, ATS-friendly formatting is used, and at least one table is readable.
- **Page 3 (Cover Letter) Proficient:** writing is professional and targeted, paragraphs are concise, and closing is complete and audience-appropriate.

## Example Quality Benchmarks

Use these models to strengthen your writing:

- **ATS-friendly summary example:**
  - `High school student seeking internship opportunities with strengths in communication, spreadsheet organization, and project support. Experienced through class projects and volunteer service, with consistent on-time completion and attention to detail.`

- **Weak vs. strong bullet example:**
  - Weak: `Helped with school event.`
